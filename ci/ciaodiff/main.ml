(* [equalities] is a list of keys to be considered equal when sorting.
   It is a map where each binding [x = y] denotes that key [x] is equal to key [y].
   It just makes them take the same spot in the order defined by this [compare_keys]
   function, which in turns makes [git diff] understand that they are to be diff'd
   with each other. If both [x] and [y] are present they will still both be present;
   no information is lost. This is useful when e.g. renaming a job and moving it to
   another place in the file. *)
