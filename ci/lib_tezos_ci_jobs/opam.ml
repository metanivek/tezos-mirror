(** Jobs testing the installability of the Octez opam packages.

    The opam packages are split into two {i groups}: those installing
    executables and the other jobs. The former group is tested more
    often (being typically the leaves the dependency graph of opam
    packages).

    Due to the large number of packages, the opam testing jobs are
    launched in a series of {i batches}. Jobs are grouped into batches as
    per their expected duration. The expected duration is based on the
    depth of it's dependency tree. Thus, jobs testing packages with a
    deeper dependency tree are launched in the first batch (the
    [batch_index] of all those jobs is 1).

    The set of opam packages, their group, and the index of its batch,
    is defined by manifest and written to the TSV file
    [script-inputs/ci-opam-package-tests]. *)
