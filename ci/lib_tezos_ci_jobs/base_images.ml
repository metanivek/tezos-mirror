(* Both amd64 and arm64 images are built on their respective native architectures
   Use 3 runners. 2 jobs for building the images, one job for merging the manifest

  (* This function can build docker images both in an emulated environment using
     qemu or natively. The advantage of choosing emulated vs native depends on
     the build time associated with the image. Small images are more efficiently
     built in an emulated environment, while larger images are better build
     natively.

     [name] is the name of the job.

     [matrix] is a parallel/matrix gitlab construct. Here we use it with the RELEASE
     variable to build multiple images for the same distribution, but different releases.

     [image_name] is the name of the final docker image.

     [base_name] is the name of the image upon the newly created image is FROM.

     [compilation] determines the type of the image.
     If [compilation] parameter is either set to [Emulated] or omitted then we
     build for two different architectures using qemu. This handles both build
     and merging the manifest of the images.

     If [compilation] is either [ Amd64_only ] or [ Arm64_only ] we build the
     images natively, but the arm64 image is going to be suffixed with "-arm64".

     If [compilation] is set to [Native] we build for both architectures using
     a native runner. In this case we also must add a merge manifest job.
