(* GRAPH TRANSFORMATIONS

   Step 1: the user specifies a list of jobs, as well as how they want those jobs
   to be triggered. This list thus have type [(trigger * job) list].

   Step 2: the [make_graph] function converts this list into a graph, of type [job_graph].
   The main differences with the original list are:
   - a [job_graph] is not a list, but a map from job UID,
     making it more efficient to work with;
   - a [job_graph] is transitively closed, i.e. all dependencies are explicitly part
     of the graph even if they were not explicitly given in the original list.
   Additionally, [make_graph] checks that the same job does not appear twice
   in the original list with different triggers.

   Step 3: the [fix_graph] function converts the [job_graph] into a [fixed_job_graph].
   This function fixes triggers and changesets.
   By "fix" we mean not only that we set them to corrected values,
   but also that these corrected values are a fixpoint.
   More precisely:
   - triggers are fixed so that if a job has trigger [Auto],
     then all of its dependencies also have trigger [Auto];
   - changesets are fixed so that if changing a file causes a job to be included,
     then changing this file also causes all dependencies of this job to be included.

   At this point, we took the *intent* of the user (given in step 1),
   and corrected it to something that actually makes sense.
   In particular this prevents some cases of invalid pipelines.

   Step 4: the [convert_graph] function converts the [fixed_job_graph]
   into a [tezos_job_graph]. This just converts all jobs to [Tezos_ci.tezos_job],
   that can be used by CIAO.

   Those successive transformations are driven by the [convert_jobs] function,
   which is used by all functions that take Cacio jobs and register them as CIAO jobs. *)
