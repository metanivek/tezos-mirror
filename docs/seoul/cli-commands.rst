This document is a prettier output of the documentation produced by
the command ``man`` of the different Octez binaries. You can obtain similar pages
using shell commands such as (:ref:`indicating the appropriate protocol <octez_client_protocol>`):

::

   octez-client -protocol <protocol_hash> man -verbosity 3

.. note::

	The rest of this page documents the protocol-dependent tools, that is, those whose behavior or features may be specific to each protocol.
	The protocol-independent tools are documented :doc:`here <../shell/cli-commands>`.
