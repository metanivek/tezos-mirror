Breaking Changes
================

This section presents the breaking changes that users may encounter
between successive protocols or successive Octez versions. It
complements the respective :ref:`protocol changelogs
<protocol_changelogs>` and :doc:`Octez changelog <../CHANGES>` by
gathering all breaking changes in one place and providing more context
when appropriate.

For each change, there may be subsections ``Deprecation`` and ``Breaking
changes``. The former subsection will explain what changes can be made during a
deprecation phase to adapt smoothly to the new changes. The latter subsection
will present the changes that can not be done by the deprecation mechanism and
that may be breaking.

In the particular case of RPC changes, you may consult complementary information on :ref:`RPC versioning <rpc_versioning>`, covering how new versions are introduced, the deprecation policy, and a concrete calendar of RPCs planned to be removed.



.. _t024_breaking_changes:

Protocol T024
-------------

:doc:`Full Protocol T024 Changelog<../protocols/024_t024>`


6s Block Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Protocol T024 reduces the block time from 8 seconds to 6 seconds on
mainnet. That is, a block can be produced with a delay of 6 seconds
with respect to the previous block, if the latter is at round 0.

Multiple protocol and smart rollup parameters have been updated in
consequence, to ensure that their duration in terms of
minutes/hours/weeks remains the same as in protocol Seoul. A full list
of affected parameters with their old and new values can be found
:ref:`here<6s_block_time_parameters_t024>`.

Unlike other parameters, the value of parameter
``smart_rollup_max_active_outbox_levels`` remains unchanged in terms
of blocks. This means that the actual duration of the maximal allowed
period of withdrawal has decreased from ~14 days in protocol Seoul to
~10 days in protocol T024.


Breaking changes to RPCs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Among the :ref:`RPC changes<t024_RPC_changes>` brought by protocol
T024, the following are potentially breaking:

- Updated RPC ``GET
  /chains/<chain_id>/blocks/<block_id>/helpers/validators`` to group
  delegates by level. The returned list contains one element for each
  queried level (by default, only the current level), and contains
  four fields: the ``level`` itself, the ``consensus_threshold``
  required for the current level, the ``consensus_committee`` of the
  current level, and ``delegates`` which is the list of validators for
  that level. Each element of this last list contains the fields
  present in the previous version of this RPC: ``delegate``, "slots"
  which have been renamed to ``rounds``, ``consensus_key``, and
  ``companion_key`` (optional).  Also include new fields for
  delegates, ``attesting_power``, with their attesting power for the
  level, and ``attestation_slot``, their slot for the given level.

- Updated RPC ``GET
  /chains/<chain_id>/blocks/<block_id>/context/issuance/expected_issuance``.
  Output field ``baking_reward_bonus_per_slot`` has been replaced with
  ``baking_reward_bonus_per_block``, and ``attesting_reward_per_slot``
  with ``attesting_reward_per_block``. Their respective values are
  consequently 7000 times as high as before (since there are 7000
  slots per block).


Removed obsolete fields from the block header and block receipts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The obsolete field ``adaptive_issuance_vote`` has been removed from
the block header in protocol T024, and fields
``adaptive_issuance_vote_ema`` and
``adaptive_issuance_activation_cycle`` from the block metadata.

Note that the adaptive issuance activation cycle (which is 748 on
mainnet) can still be queried via the RPC ``GET
/chains/<chain>/blocks/<block>/context/adaptive_issuance_launch_cycle``.


Very slight increase in gas cost when calling smart contracts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Protocol T024 fixes a minor bug that caused some gas costs to be
omitted in cache functions. As a result, gas costs for smart contract
calls has increased by at most 2 units of gas each time the cache is
accessed.



.. _v23_breaking_changes:

Octez Version 23
----------------

:doc:`Full Octez Version 23 Changelog<../releases/version-23>`

Operation encoding changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiple client commands and RPCs in Octez v23 are affected by the
:ref:`operation encoding changes in protocol Seoul described
below<operation_encodings_s>`. It is recommended to update any tool
producing or processing reveal operations to a Seoul-compatible
version.


Unique baker executable and unique accuser executable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with Octez v23, the single executable ``octez-baker``
(previously named ``octez-experimental-agnostic-baker``) is no longer
experimental, and should be preferred over the protocol-suffixed
executables ``octez-baker-<proto-hash>``, which will be deprecated in
``v24``, and will be removed in a later version.

Similarly, Octez v23 also introduces a single executable
``octez-accuser`` meant to gradually replace the protocol-suffixed
executables ``octez-accuser-<proto-hash>``.


Stricter validation for JSON configuration files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previously, the parser would silently ignore any content that appeared
after the first valid JSON object. Starting with Octez v23.0~rc2, any
extraneous data in a configuration file will cause the function to
return an error.

This change affects the configuration files of the node, client,
signer, baker, accuser, smart rollup node, and DAL node.



.. _seoul_breaking_changes:

Protocol Seoul
--------------

:doc:`Full Protocol Seoul Changelog<../protocols/023_seoul>`

.. _operation_encodings_s:

Operation encoding changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Protocol Seoul adds new operations and changes the encoding of some
existing operations, for instance by adding new fields.
These changes are related to the support for tz4 BLS addresses and their aggregated signatures.

Backward compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the changes in the encodings of existing operations are either purely added operations (e.g. ``update_companion_key``) or optional fields that should not break (e.g., for operations ``reveal`` and ``update_consensus_key``).

.. warning::

  However, tool providers which do not use encodings but rather :doc:`p2p message
  format <../shell/p2p_api>` may experience some issues. For example, the ``reveal``
  operation has a new boolean field to mark the presence of the optional ``proof`` for
  tz4 revelation.
  Users of such tools should check that they are operating versions compatible with the changes introduced by the Seoul protocol, and upgrade them if needed.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in protocol Seoul, the ``Double_preattestation_evidence`` and
``Double_attestation_evidence`` operations are replaced with a
new ``Double_consensus_operation_evidence`` operation,
in order to enable denunciations of aggregated consensus operations. This new
operation contains a denounced slot and two denounced consensus
operations. For the evidence to be valid, the denounced operations
must both be preattestations (each one may be aggregated or not) or
both be attestations. Moreover, both must involve the denounced
slot, that is, be either a standalone operation for this slot or an
aggregate whose committee includes this slot.
The receipts for these operations have also been reworked, see :ref:`seoul_receipts_changes`.

All existing tz4 addresses are being unrevealed when protocol S is adopted, and they must provide a proof of possession to be revealed again, see :ref:`seoul_changelog_breaking_changes`.
This proof may be generated using the client command::

	octez-client create bls proof for <alias>


Octez Version 22
----------------

:doc:`Full Octez Version 22 Changelog<../releases/version-22>`

Baker: Explicit choice on using DAL or not via the CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Octez ``v21.3`` introduces the new ``--without-dal`` option for the baker daemon.
In Octez ``v21.3``, this option is not mandatory and will only trigger a warning.

Starting from Octez ``v22``, launching a baker daemon requires an explicit mention of the DAL.
The recommended approach is to run a DAL node and start the baker using the ``--dal-node <uri>`` option.
If you do not wish to use a DAL node, you can opt-out by using the ``--without-dal`` option.
