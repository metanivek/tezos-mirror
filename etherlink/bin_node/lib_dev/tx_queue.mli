(** The Tx_queue is a worker allowing to batch raw transactions in a single
    [eth_sendRawTransaction] at a regular interval. It provides a non-blocking
    interface based on the use of callbacks. *)

(** A [callback] is called by the [Tx_queue] at various stages of a
    submitted transaction's life.

    The next tick after its insertion in the queue, a transaction is submitted
    to the relay node within a batch of [eth_sendRawTransaction] requests.

    {ul
      {li Depending on the result of the RPC, its [callback] is called with
          either [`Accepted] or [`Refused]).}
      {li As soon as the transaction appears in a blueprint, its callback is
          called with [`Confirmed]. If this does not happen before 2s, the
          [callback] is called with [`Dropped].}} *)
type callback = [`Accepted | `Confirmed | `Dropped | `Refused] -> unit Lwt.t

(** [tx_container ~chain_family] is a pair [(start, container)] where
    [start ~config ~max_transaction_batch_length ()] starts the
    worker, meaning it is possible to call {!inject}, {!confirm} and
    {!beacon} and [container] is a wrapper of the Tx_queue to be
    compatible with the Tx_container signature for the services. *)
