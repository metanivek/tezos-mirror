Dynamic parameter description:
  
  <block_id>
      A block identifier. This can take one of the following
      values:
	1.Block-hash - Hash in Base58Check notation.
	2.Alias - One of
      the following:'genesis/ head/ caboose/ savepoint/
      checkpoint'.
	3.Block-level - index(integer) in the chain.
	One can
      also specify the relative positions of block with respect to above
      three block identifiers. For ex. 'checkpoint~N' or checkpoint+N, where
      N is an integer, denotes the Nth block before(~) or after (+) the
      checkpoint. 
  <chain_id>
