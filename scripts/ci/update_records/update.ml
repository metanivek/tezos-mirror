    "UPDATE TEZT RECORDS"
    ~description:
      {|Update records in tezt/records by fetching them from a pipeline.

Example: to fetch test result records from https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/pipelines/426773806, run (from the root of the repository):

dune exec scripts/ci/update_records/update.exe -- --from 426773806

You can use the PROJECT environment variable to specify which GitLab repository to fetch records from. Default is: tezos/tezos

The script can also be used to fetch records from the last successful pipeline on the latest MR merged to the default branch (configurable through the DEFAULT_BRANCH environment variable) for a given PROJECT:

dune exec scripts/ci/update_records/update.exe -- --from last-merged-pipeline|}
