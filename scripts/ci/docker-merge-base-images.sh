# create_and_push_manifest TAG
#
# This function creates and pushes a multi-architecture Docker manifest for the
# specified tag. It references two platform-specific images (amd64 and arm64)
# that were previously pushed using a unique build tag derived from the current
# Git commit.
#
# Arguments:
#   TAG - The tag to apply to the multi-arch manifest (e.g., "main", "develop",
#   or a commit-based tag).
#
# Behavior:
#   - Assembles a manifest list for the given tag using architecture-specific
#     image tags: ${LATEST_TAG}-amd64 and ${LATEST_TAG}-arm64
#   - Annotates each image with its respective architecture
#   - Pushes the final multi-arch manifest to the container registry
#
# Usage:
#   create_and_push_manifest "${LATEST_TAG}"
#   create_and_push_manifest "${LATEST_TAG_GENERIC}"
#
# Note:
#   Assumes IMAGE_NAME, LATEST_TAG, and platform-specific images are already
#   set and pushed.

LATEST_TAG_GENERIC="${RELEASE}-${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}"
