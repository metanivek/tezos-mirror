(** [update_timing_shard_received shards_timing_table  ~last_expected_shards slot_id]
    updates the timing metrics associated with [slot_id] in the [shards_timing_table].

    This function should be called each time a shard is received. It records the
    timestamp of the first shard received for a slot, and updates the duration
    when all shards are received.
    The [last_expected_shard] boolean indicates that this shard is the last
    expected one, meaning that if all shards received until now are valid, then
    the slot is attestable (in attester mode) / we have all the
    [cryptobox_parameters.number_of_shards] shards for the slot (in observer mode).

    This function outputs the up-to-date [slot_metrics] with a [boolean] stating
    if it has been updated or not.

    No I/O is performed; the function only modifies the in-memory timing table.

(** [update_timing_shard_validated shards_timing_table  ~number_of_already_stored_shards

    updates the timing metrics associated with [slot_id] in the [shards_timing_table].

    This function should be called each time a shard is validated.
    This function is very similar to [update_timing_shard_received].
    There are two main differences:
    - Since this function is called after validation, the shard has been added
      to the store, hence this function uses the [number_of_already_stored_shards]
      and the [number_of_expected_shards] to compute itself if it is the last
      expected shard that just got validated.
    - If the [min_shards_to_reconstruct_slot] argument is passed, it also updates
      the time when this number of shards are validated.

    No I/O is performed; the function only modifies the in-memory timing table.
