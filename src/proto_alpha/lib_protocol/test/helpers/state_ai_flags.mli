  (** This module takes care of the flags [force_activation] and
      [activation_vote_enable], and updates and check the record field
      [ai_activation_cycle] in the state. *)

  (** [AI_Activation] is enabled iff either of the above flags are set to true,
      or the vote threshold is set to 0 (regardless of votes).
      "Enabled" here means that AI *can* be activated (either by vote
      or by force), but does not mean that AI is activated *)

      Run at the beginning, and after every block to check the activation
      cycle is set only once ever. *)

module AI : sig

  (** AI is enabled iff the activation cycle is set and passed *)
